# Inheritance

- inheritance is the process in which the one object acquires all the properites and behaviors of its parent object automatically

###### Advantage:
- Code reusability

## Types of Inheritance:
- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance

###### terms used in Inheritance:

#### dervied classes:
- a class derived from the base class
```cpp
// Syntax
class derived_classname :: visibility-mode base_classname{

}
```
```cpp
class dog :: public animal{

}
```

```css
- In cpp, the default mode of visibility is private
- The private members of the base class are never inherited.
```

### Single Inheritance:
- Single inheritance is defined as the inheritance in which a derived class is inherited from the only one base class.
---
### Multiple Inheritance:
- Multiple inheritance is the process of deriving a new class that inherits the attributes from two or more classes.
---
### Hierarchical Inheritance:
- Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.
---
### Multilevel Inheritance:
- Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.
---
### Hybrid Inheritance
--- Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.
