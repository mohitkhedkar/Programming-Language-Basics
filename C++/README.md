## Features of C++

1) Better memory management – you can dynamically allocate memory during runtime using new and delete operator in C++ to have better memory management.

2) Object oriented – C++ supports object oriented programming features, which means we can use the popular OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Inheritance in C++ programs, these features make writing code in C++ a lot easier. We will cover them in detail in this tutorial series.

3) Portable – Most of C++ compilers supports ANSI standards that makes C++ portable because the code you write on one operating system can be run on other Operating system without making any change. We cannot say C++ a fully platform independent language as certain things in C++ are not portable, such as drawing graphics on a screen, since standard C++ has no graphics or GUI API.

4) Structured programming language – We have functions in C++, which makes easier to break a problem into small blocks of code and structure the program in such a way so that it improves readability and reusability.

5) Exception handling: Just like Java we can do exception handling in C++ which makes it easier to identify and handle the exceptions.

6) Simple – Last but not least, just like C, it is easier to write a program in C++. Once you get familiar with the syntax of C++ programming language, it becomes a lot easier to code in C++.
